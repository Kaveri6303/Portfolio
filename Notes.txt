I developed a responsive personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
 The goal was to showcase my technical skills, educational background, work experience, 
 and completed projects in a clean and organized manner. The website includes different sections 
 like About Me, Services I offer, My Work portfolio, and Contact information.
  It also features an interactive navigation menu, a downloadable resume, 
  and a contact form connected to Google Sheets to collect user messages.
   This project highlights my front-end development abilities and provides visitors with 
   a professional view of my profile."
